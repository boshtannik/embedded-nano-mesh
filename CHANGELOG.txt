1.1.0 - * Update README.
        * Fix bug with receiving FinishTransaction packet from other transaction session,
          which led to mess-up. The previous transaction packet could break current transaction process.
          Now - the protocol distunguishes one transaction from another by expected packet_id in response.
        * The same bug for ping-pong was fixed too.
        * API simplified: No longer need of instantiating of complex enums to provide during sending.
        * 1.0.5 Fully Compatible.

1.1.1 - * README fix.
1.1.2 - * README fix, Renamings of other repositories included.
1.1.3 - * README adjust.
1.1.4 - * README fix.
1.2.0 - * Readme adjust
        * Significally reduce code duplication and amount of unnecessary types conversion.
        * Example of arduino receive binary shrank for about 1kb.
        * Example of arduino send binary shrank for about 300 bytes.
2.0.0 - * Update README with diagrams
        * Major version change due to the API change.
        * Adjust work principle of transactions, it broke backward compatibility on transactions only.
        * No more dependency PlatformSerial trait in order to provide
          ability to use more interfaces than just USART, Library now just depends on
          embedded_serial trait.
        * No more dependency on PlatformMillis trait. Now for time calculation
          library uses Fn() -> ms (ms is u32 alias) closure that just returns ms since program start.
        * Node now again can ping itself trough the network and make transaction to itself.
        * Restored feature of transaction to itself.
          For use of transactions - all nodes shall support version 2.0.0.
