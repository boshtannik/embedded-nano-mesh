1.1.0 - * Update README.
        * Fix bug with receiving FinishTransaction packet from other transaction session,
          which led to mess-up. The previous transaction packet could break current transaction process.
          Now - the protocol distunguishes one transaction from another by expected packet_id in response.
        * The same bug for ping-pong was fixed too.
        * API simplified: No longer need of instantiating of complex enums to provide during sending.
        * 1.0.5 Fully Compatible.

1.1.1 - * README fix.
1.1.2 - * README fix, Renamings of other repositories included.
1.1.3 - * README adjust.
